# Python Profanity Filter
Python Profanity Filter or PPF for short is a simple script that you can incorperate to any project that needs a little censor to it. I **DEFINITLY** plan on adding more to this, to make the script just that much more better. For now enjoy this small script that you can use with a little bit of credit ;)
